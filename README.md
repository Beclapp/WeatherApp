# WeatherApp
Simple Weather webpage, taking an API from accuweather using REACT elements while using user input.  My main goals in this project were to successfully use an API for a program, which I was able to do.  I didn't spend time styling it, but I have since learned more about CSS, especially when working with the ProjectViewer project.
